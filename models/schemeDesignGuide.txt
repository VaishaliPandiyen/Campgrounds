    MONGO DB SCHEMA DESIGN PARADOX OF CHOICE

GOOD PRACTICES:
    1. Denormalising is referencing from one model document to another.
        a. We can duplicate data in our documents if needed/efficient.
        b. It's not wise to duplicate frequently updated fields' data. You can two-way reference instead.
    2. Dulicating is allowed (not recommended mostly) when there's frequent access of only one of the populated information.
    3. Embedding means nesting.
        a. Embedding is good and favourable.
        b. But you don't need to embed if the contained info can/will be used without the parent context.
        c. It's a good practice to have upper limits to the info in the nested key:value array.
